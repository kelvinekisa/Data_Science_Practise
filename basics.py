# Python basics
x = 2

# Addition
z = x + y

# Augments Assignment operator
# Addition and assignment
x =+ y     # Equivalent to:  x = x + y

# subtraction and Assignment
x -= y      # Equivalent to: x = x - y

# multiplication and assignment
x *= y      # Equivalent to: x = x * y

# Division and assignment
x /= y      # Equivalent to: x = x/y
